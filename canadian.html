  <p class="coin">Five Cent :</p>
  <p class="details">The five-cent coin in Canada is commonly referred to as the "nickel" since it is made up of 75%
    copper and 25% nickel. The coin weighs 3.95g and has a 21.2mm diameter. On the front of the Canadian nickel is a
    picture of Queen Elizabeth II. Over the years, the back side has included a number of designs, including a beaver, a
    wolf, a fish, and a maple leaf. The 50th anniversary of the legalization of homosexuality in Canada was honored by a
    special five-cent coin that was produced by the Royal Canadian Mint in 2019. On the back of the coin, a stylized
    maple leaf and the words "EQUALITY - DIVERSITY - LIBERTY - JUSTICE" are printed.</p>

  <p class="coin">Ten Cents :</p>
  <p class="details">The "dime" is the common name for the ten-cent coin in use in Canada. It is made of an alloy called
    cupronickel, which is 91.5% copper and 8.5% nickel. The coin weighs 1.75g and has an 18.03mm diameter. The back side
    of the Canadian dime features the Canadian Bluenose schooner, a well-known fishing and racing vessel that is a
    significant icon of Canadian maritime history. The front side of the coin depicts a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II.
    Since the Canadian dime's introduction in 1937, only minor changes have been made to the Bluenose picture and a few
    modifications have been made to Queen Elizabeth II's face.</p>

  <p class="coin">Twenty Five Cents :</p>
  <p class="details">The twenty-five cent coin is referred to as the "quarter" in Canada. It is made of an alloy called
    cupronickel, which is 94% steel and 6% nickel and has nickel coating on the edge. The coin weighs 4.4g and is
    23.88mm in diameter. The back side of the Canadian quarter has different designs that occasionally change, while the
    front side depicts a picture of Queen Elizabeth II. Images of Canadian landscapes, wildlife, and significant
    historical individuals have been featured in some recent designs. As part of the Canada 150 commemoration in 2017,
    the Royal Canadian Mint issued a series of quarters, each of which featured a unique design honoring a province or
    territory in Canada.</p>

  <p class="coin">One Dollar :</p>
  <p class="details">The traditional name for the Canadian one-dollar coin, the "loonie," comes from the back side's
    picture of a common loon. The coin has a diameter of 26.5mm, weighs 6.27g, and is made of a bimetallic composition
    consisting of a nickel outer ring and a brass inner core. The back side of the Canadian $1 coin depicts a common
    loon swimming in a lake, while the front side shows a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II. The loonie, which was first
    introduced in 1987 to replace the one-dollar note in Canada, has since grown to be a well-known representation of
    that country's money.</p>

  <p class="coin">Two Dollar :</p>
  <p class="details">The "toonie" is the common name for the two-dollar coin in use in Canada. In Canada, it was
    introduced in 1996 to take the place of the two-dollar note. The toonie has a diameter of 28mm, weighs 6.92g, and is
    made of a bimetallic composition with an inner core made of pure nickel and an outside ring made of aluminum bronze.
    The polar bear design is included on the Canadian toonie's back side, while the front side features Queen Elizabeth
    II. The polar bear design was chosen in a nationwide competition, with wildlife artist Brent Townsend producing the
    winning entry.</p>
